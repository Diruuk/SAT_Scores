SAT Scores and the Factors that Affect Them
Introduction
The Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it. The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points.Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

There is controversy around this test (and other standardized tests) though: are they unfair to certain groups?

In this study we will investigate correlations between SAT scores and demographics like race, gender, income, and more.

Objectives
Determine if there are any interesting correlations and analyze them
Figure out which neighborhoods have the best schools
If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
Investigate the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.
Assign scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.
Data
We will make us of data that is published by the City of New York. This includes SAT scores, demographic information and other data that is useful for our study. Here are the links to all of the data sets we'll be using:

SAT scores by school: SAT scores for each high school in New York City
School attendance: attendance information for each school in New York City
Class size: information on class size for each school
AP test results: Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
Graduation outcomes: The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
Demographics: Demographic information for each school
School survey: Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
