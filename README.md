<p># SAT Scores and the Factors that Affect Them</p>
<p>## Introduction</p>
<p>The Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it. The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points.Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.</p>

<p>There is controversy around this test (and other standardized tests) though: are they unfair to certain groups?</p>

<p>In this study we will investigate correlations between SAT scores and demographics like race, gender, income, and more.</p>

<p>### Objectives</p>

* Determine if there are any interesting correlations and analyze them
* Figure out which neighborhoods have the best schools
 * If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
* Investigate the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.
* Assign scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.

<p>### Data</p>
<p>We will make us of data that is published by the City of New York. This includes SAT scores, demographic information and other data that is useful for our study.</p>
